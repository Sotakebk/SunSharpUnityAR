# SunSharp Unity VR Demo
This is a pseudo-VR project that doubles as a demo and the go-to testing and development setup of the [SunSharp for Unity](https://github.com/Sotakebk/SunSharp) package.

Work in progress!
## How to setup
Instead of installing the package as you would through the Package Manager, the project references it as a local directory. This means that both repositories should be located in one parent folder, like this:

    ├── Whatever                    # Your parent directory
        ├── SunSharpUnity           # Cloned package repository
        └── SunSharpUnity_VRDemo    # YOU ARE HERE!
